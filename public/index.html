      Notice the use of public in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "public/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <noscript>We introduce 'PrioVar,' where bioinformatics meet precision to transform rare disease diagnosis, and where health clinics become interconnected for a 
      collective impact. Our project is a cutting-edge genetic variant prioritization tool tailored for health clinics, designed to seamlessly integrate 
      phenotype data into the decision-making process. Clinics can prioritize genetic variants in order to make more accurate predictions about the causes 
      behind rare diseases, exchange valuable variant frequency information via our interface, and gain access to anonymous data from individuals with similar 
      phenotypes/genotypes with known diseases, all of which collectively revolutionize the detection and understanding of genetic conditions. Our mission is 
      simple: empower early and accurate diagnosis, ultimately improving the lives of those affected by rare diseases.</noscript>
